# LG Electronics Smart Manufacturing Strategy Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This capstone project was conducted in collaboration with LG Electronics as part of our academic curriculum at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. The goal was to propose strategic smart manufacturing solutions to enhance operational efficiency, reduce defects, and strengthen competitiveness in LGâ€™s EV battery production. The initiative was aligned with Industry 4.0 technologies, including AI-driven visual inspection, SPC+, and automation integration.

## My Role: Team Leader & Business Analyst
As the team leader, I oversaw a four-member consulting team, serving as the primary liaison between LG stakeholders and the university team. I guided the research scope, defined deliverables, managed weekly meetings, and presented final insights to LG management.

## Objectives
- Diagnose inefficiencies in the high-precision battery assembly process.
- Identify applicable Industry 4.0 technologies.
- Design a digital transformation roadmap for LGâ€™s EV battery production line.
- Quantify the potential ROI and performance impact of each proposed solution.

## Key Deliverables & Results
- Conducted primary interviews with plant managers, engineers, and production leads.
- Benchmarked use of AI and SPC systems in analogous industries such as aerospace and medical.
- Delivered a transformation strategy projected to reduce visual inspection defects by **35%**.
- Calculated a projected **$300K+ annual savings** through improved SPC system deployment.
- Built a cost-benefit analysis showing a **projected 8,900% ROI** for recommended solutions.
- Proposed a tiered implementation timeline including quick wins and long-term scalability.
